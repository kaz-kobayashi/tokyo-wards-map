=======
Tokyo Wards Map is an experimental project that provides an interactive map of Tokyo's 23 special wards. The aim is to visualize ward boundaries and basic information in a simple web interface.

The project is built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). You can use any mapping library such as [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) or [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to render the geographic data. At the moment the repository does not contain a full implementation, but the steps below describe how you would typically set it up and run it once the source files are present.

## Setup and Installation

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) if they are not already available on your system.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <this-repo-url>
   cd tokyo-wards-map
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will serve the site locally, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.
5. To build the project for production use:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running you will be able to pan and zoom the map of Tokyo. Clicking on a ward should display its name and other details in a sidebar or popâ€‘up.
